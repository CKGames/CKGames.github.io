Hi Yun Fei,

Hope you're doing well.

One thing I like about is that you put the 3D model demo and the video of yourself together, users can see what you want to demo to them.
It would be nice if you do transactions by clicking effects --> video transaction in adobe premium pro to make it smoother.
As for the background part of the website, you can try out using background-size: contain; to make it looks more consistent.

Hope these can help.
